        <section id="history" class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="text-primary">History and Background of Kaborok Assembly</h2>
            <p>Around the year 2000, rumors and whispers about sacred names began to spread at Kaborok. This was followed by frequent meetings of research by a group of men who used to converge at Kaborok Primary and their residence.</p>
            <p>After some time, more light came in and the men discovered that indeed the sacred name movement was real and there were groups, especially in America, who worship using sacred names. Later on, a man named Paul Langat, who was part of the team that taught the sacred names, gave out the address of the Assembly of Yahweh that existed in Michigan. The elders present during the talks agreed to request teaching aids from the Assembly of Yahweh, which were later received quarterly as “The Faith Magazine.”</p>
            <p>Things became more real when we began to learn the sacred names of Yahweh and Yahshua through the Faith Magazine. The elders started teaching others. The usual convergence for research turned out to be a convergence of worship of sacred name believers. Then arose the idea of what name to give to the congregation. There were discussions on whether to call it the Assembly of Yahweh in Messiah or the Messianic Assembly of Yahweh. Nevertheless, the elders discovered it meant the same thing. Thereafter came the idea of registration and leadership. The elders varied greatly on the issue as some elders decided that the Assembly should be registered as a new Assembly under Elder Paul Langat, who declared himself bishop and anointed deacons and pastors.</p>
            <p>Some of the elders, including Elder Joseph Mitei and Eliud Chepkwony, advised further consultations, and this brought a disagreement. The idea of the existence of other sacred name believers in Kenya who could already be registered came in. It was indeed discovered that the Messianic Assembly of Yahweh did exist under <a href="#">Bishop Peter G. Kihara</a> . The elders reached a decision to find more about the Messianic Assembly of Yahweh. Elder Joseph Mitei, Eliud Chepkwony, and David Kirui went to Zimmerman in Nairobi to meet Bishop Peter Kihara, who showed them the national headquarters, structure, and registration of the Assembly. The elders came back from Nairobi convinced beyond reasonable doubt to adopt the Messianic Assembly of Yahweh.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Bishop Peter Kihara and his team of elders visited Kaborok in August 2004, where deliberations were done at Mitei’s home. Miraculously, a child named Miriam was born after a long period of anticipation. Up to date, her age is equal to the Assembly.</p>
            <p>Later in October 2004, Bishop Peter again made a visit to Kaborok together with other pastors and elders and more interestingly, visitors from abroad led by Elder Jacob C. Meyer. The team was hosted at Martin Barchok’s place, who generously welcomed the visitors. This marked the beginning of labor pains followed by the birth of the Kaborok Assembly. During the formation of the Assembly, six children were baptized by Elder Jacob C. Meyer together with Bishop Peter Kihara. These were Joseph Mitei, Eliud Chepkwony, Isaiah Chirchir, Stanley Rotich, David Mutai, and Josphat Langat.</p>
            <p>Joseph Mitei was ordained as the first pastor of the Messianic Assembly of Yahweh Kaborok. Two deacons were also picked, namely David Tonui and Josphat Langat. Later, Pastor Joseph Mitei was appointed as the South Rift Region Overseer. Later again, Pastor Stephen Ng’ang’a was appointed as South Rift Overseer and holds the position to date.</p>
            <p>The Assembly grew with great support from Bishop Peter Kihara and frequent visits by Elder Jacob C. Meyer and others from abroad. Worship was always done at Kaborok Primary School, and not even one Sabbath service has failed to date.</p>
            <p>Despite several challenges, another ordination was done for Pastor Stanley Rotich in the year 2009, who led the Assembly until 2017 when he left. In the year 2010, a Bible scripture institute was established by Pastor George Kariuki, and members enrolled for Bible study and thereafter graduated. In the year 2017, Pastor Eliud Chepkwony was ordained pastor and has been pastoring up to date. He has led the Assembly as Chairman for many years. The Assembly has been led by a strong board led by Chairman Richard Mutai and other leaders. In October 2023, other leaders were ordained as ministers. Richard Mutai was anointed as pastor, and Isaiah Chirchir was ordained as deacon. Isaac Koech was later received and ordained pastor.</p>
            <p>On the development point of view, the Assembly has undergone numerous uplifts. With prayers and trust in Yahweh, the members put their efforts into acquiring a plot to build a worship hall. Yahweh miraculously sent us support through Bishop Peter G. Kihara, who reached brethren from Reach for Yahweh International Ministries, who selflessly decided to fund our tiny Assembly to a magnificent Assembly as you can attest today. From grass to grace, the Assembly is flourishing with life; Yahweh is with His people. The current Assembly hall and guest house were constructed in the year 2014 and completed in the year 2015 during the Tabernacle Feast. The land was also extended during the same period and leveling done. Trees and flowers have been planted throughout to keep the compound as beautiful as it is.</p>
            <p>The Assembly ground has held so many events, including feasts, seminars, weddings, artists’ celebrations, and other activities. The guest house has hosted a great delegation since its construction. In the year 2015, the Assembly hosted the greatest National Feast of Tabernacles, which was spectacular. The Assembly hosted a great wedding ceremony of Faith and Edmond in 2018 that was of its kind being the first to be done at the venue. Another one of Miriam and Alfred was done in the year 2022. The Assembly has also hosted the National MMF in June 2024. Recently in 2023, a modern kitchen foundation was laid by Pastor Eliud Chepkwony, and through the members’ effort and other well-wishers, the structure is almost complete. The new kitchen was officially opened in June 2024 by Bishop Peter G. Kihara. Again we say to Yahweh be the glory.</p>
            <p>We stand here today, my brothers and sisters, to testify to the great work Yahweh has done through Brother Dwayne and Reach for Yahweh Team. Behold how magnificent the worship hall and guest house is. Their efforts, together with fellow brethren in America and whoever donated towards the structures, stand blessed today. The buildings will stand a test of time and will be used by many generations to come, Yahweh willing. Indeed, it is even miraculous to see the plot extended as Elder Dwayne had foreseen and prayed for it. Now we have space to do whatever Yahweh will allow us on the extended plot. The Assembly has grown in all aspects. On the side of evangelism, the Assembly has led to the growth of other branches such as Chemalal, Kebeneti/Mwebem Kapsoit, and lately Berea/Nyabangi Assembly. The branch in Kapsoit was opened in September 2022 under acting Pastor Edmond Bore and has continued well. The Assembly was earlier existing in Kericho Town, where Pastor Paul Bett was pastoring. Earlier this year, Berea Assembly Sabbath school was opened under Pastor Isaac Koech and has since picked up well. Numerous evangelical activities and visitations have been done over the past years and specifically this year (2024) as we celebrate 20 years of our anniversary. There are currently three pastors under the Kaborok Assembly, namely Pastor Eliud Chepkwony, who is the resident pastor; Pastor Richard Mutai, in charge of the Diaspora; and Pastor Isaac Koech, in charge of Nyabangi/Kabianga branch.</p>
