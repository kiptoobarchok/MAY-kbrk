                        The Messianic Assembly of Yahweh - KABOROK began its journey of faith in the late 1980s, inspired by a small group of devoted believers seeking to restore the ancient paths of worship as outlined in the Scriptures. With a deep conviction for truth and a passion for community, these pioneers established a foundation that continues to guide the assembly today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        In its early years, the church met in humble homes and under open skies, united by a shared commitment to Yahweh and His teachings. Despite facing challenges, the faithful congregation grew steadily, attracting members from diverse backgrounds who sought to deepen their understanding of the Word.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        By the mid-1990s, the assembly had outgrown its informal meeting spaces and laid the groundwork for constructing its first sanctuary. This monumental step symbolized the community's resilience and dedication to providing a sacred space for worship, fellowship, and spiritual growth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">

                    <p class="card-text">
                        One of the defining moments in the church's history was the introduction of the Hebrew Calendar into its worship practices. This shift marked a return to the biblical rhythms of time, aligning the community's celebrations and observances with Yahweh's appointed times.

                    <p class="card-text">
