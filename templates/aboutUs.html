                        The Messianic Assembly of Yahweh - KABOROK began its journey of faith in the late 1980s, inspired by a small group of devoted believers seeking to restore the ancient paths of worship as outlined in the Scriptures. With a deep conviction for truth and a passion for community, these pioneers established a foundation that continues to guide the assembly today.

                        In its early years, the church met in humble homes and under open skies, united by a shared commitment to Yahweh and His teachings. Despite facing challenges, the faithful congregation grew steadily, attracting members from diverse backgrounds who sought to deepen their understanding of the Word.

                        By the mid-1990s, the assembly had outgrown its informal meeting spaces and laid the groundwork for constructing its first sanctuary. This monumental step symbolized the community's resilience and dedication to providing a sacred space for worship, fellowship, and spiritual growth.

                        One of the defining moments in the church's history was the introduction of the Hebrew Calendar into its worship practices. This shift marked a return to the biblical rhythms of time, aligning the community's celebrations and observances with Yahweh's appointed times.

                        The assembly has also prioritized youth empowerment and education, launching various programs to equip the younger generation with spiritual, academic, and practical skills. These efforts aim to nurture future leaders who will carry forward the legacy of faith.
